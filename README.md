# ENDERON
My modification of an Creality ENDER3 V2 to have a VORON Stealthburner toolhead. It includes:
- Stealthburner mounting plate to use with CW2
- X motor cover to route the wires going from the toolhead to the main control board
- Cable anchor to hold the cables coming from the X motor down along the Z axis

NOTE: I strongly suggest having a double Z motor mod on your ENDER to avoid X beam slag due to the toolhead weight increase.
